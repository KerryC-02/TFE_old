  content: Everyone secretly guesses she used to be a big boss behind the Ghost Claw
    gang, how did she end up running for mayor? Her embroidered steel arm is much
    more expensive than these junk we use! This woman is willing to speak for us,
    just a bit too affectionate. It's good to raise the hourly wage, but giving civil
    rights to bioroids is another story! So many iron cans retired from the front,
    you can't tell them apart in a crowd.
